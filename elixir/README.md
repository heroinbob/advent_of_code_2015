# Advent

This is my FIRST ever Elixir project. I have no idea what I'm doing, so why not
try to do the Advent Of Code using it?

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add advent to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:advent, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure advent is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:advent]]
        end
